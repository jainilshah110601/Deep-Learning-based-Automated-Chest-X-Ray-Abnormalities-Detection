# Deep-Learning-based-Automated-Chest-X-Ray-Abnormalities-Detection
Machine Learning Model in Python to detect &amp; localize lung and heart diseases. Our goal was to be able to automatically identify and localize multiple points of interest in a provided chest X-ray and act as a second level of certainty after the radiologists.
